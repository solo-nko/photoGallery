# Photo Gallery

## What is it?

My personal website. Content-wise, it currently most focused on my hobby of photography.

## Why does it exist?

I wanted a way to apply my learning in HTML, CSS and Javascript to something practical and perhaps even useful. More specifically, I wanted practice in *combining* the three, as while I've studied each of them in turn, implementing JavaScript on a webpage is still new to me.

## What's it do?

Presently, it mainly just displays photos and information. While it has a Contact page, there isn't really any functionality built into it. I did however build a simple dark mode button.

## Technologies

This project uses pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It has animations built using CSS, and a theme toggle built with a combination of CSS and JavaScript.
