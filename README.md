# Nick's Photo Gallery

This is meant to serve as my personal website. I call it the Photo Gallery because I originally envisioned it as a portfolio to show off some of my photography, which I do as a hobby.

## What's it do?

It's my portfolio! Not just the site itself, but the code powering it. I want to show off my hobby of photography, but also show interested parties what I've learned so far in areas of web development and information technology.

## What's it built on?

This project is built using pure HTML, CSS and a bit of JavaScript. Currently, I test new features and ideas for it on the workspace branch.
